            I started learning to program as a hobby while in my third year of
            college, and I completed codecademy's 30-hour intro to JS course, as
            well as their intro to HTML and CSS courses. I
            decided I really like programming and want to become a Web
            Developer. I immediately applied as a full-time student in Lambda
            School's Full-Stack Web Developer and Computer Science program, and
            was accepted a couple of weeks later. Lambda School is one of the
            most difficult things I've ever done, but it was totally worth it.
            By the way, check out my awesome work

              was a solo side project I created to test out my skills with Cursor, AI Agents, Wispr Flow, Firebase, React, and Tailwind CSS.
              It is a collaborative canvas tool very similar to Figma!
              I worked on this as part of the Gauntlet AI fellowship program. It features real-time database sync for user 
              presence, object selection, cursor movement, and object dragging. The rest of the persisted data is handled by the Firebase store.

              Ever thought it'd be great to have a messaging/groupchat app for remote work? This project was a continuation of learning how to build using AI.
              It's a react-native expo app designed with remote workers in mind. Messages of high priority are automatically marked in red. Dropdown actions in any chat include
              conversation summarization, key decisions, action items, and semantic search (keyword weight + vector embedding comparison). Firebase for realtime chat functionality. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I used gpt-4o-mini for all functionality, and openai text embedding 3 small for semantic search.

              was our first group project. Imagine if a single, simple (or long and complex as needed!) prompt generated TV-ready video advertisements within 3-4 minutes.
              That's our VideoAI Studio! With optional product/logo reference image upload, we implemented a multi-step video generation pipeline. Steps include checking for relevant
              asset images using our RAG pipeline, video and scene composition planning, storyboard image generation, parallel video chunk generation, final stitching, and an optional
              analysis + music track addition (depending on model used, some support sound out of the box). Post-generation processing also allows users to regenerate specific chunks
              and restitch! The 3 of us finished this project in one week. My primary role was designing and implementing most of the orchestration pipeline.
              <br>
              <br>
              This project was a great learning opportunity for combining all of our new skills up to this point. Models used include gpt-4o-mini for reasoning steps
              (checking for relevant assets step, planning step), gpt-4-turbo for image analysis, flux-dev for image gen, flux-dev-controlnet for image gen WITH reference asset,
              and Google Veo 3.1 OR Minimax Hailuo 2.3 Fast for chunk generation. All deployed using Python FastAPI, and celery + redis task queues to scale multiple videos and/or
              multiple users.

              is simple in concept, but powerful. It's a real world usecase of how we can superpower learning using AI. What if you could use an LLM to actually teach you concepts as a 
              personal tutor, rather than just spitting out answers? That's MathMentor AI, a personal math tutoring assistant for ANY level of mathematics. The trick is to provide
              our own state to the LLM to track problem attempts, user frustration, hint quantity, and hint strength, which can increase or reset depending on how stuck
              the student is. Simply type out a problem or upload an image of problems and see for yourself!
              <br>
              <br>
              I used GPT-4-Turbo and the Vercel AI SDK to power my tutoring agent. React, tailwind, and a next.js serverless API deployed on Vercel.

              is another powerful real world usecase of how to superpower existing applications using AI. In this case, I built an AI-powered recommendation engine. After
              being granted permission, we first outline a "persona" based off of this user's spending, saving, and investment habits. We can then recommend relevant products
              OR learning resources that fit the exact usecase. A good saver might want to learn about investing. Someone with lots of subscriptions might want a subscriptions
              manager! 
              <br>
              <br>
              Considering the reasoning required for accurate recommendations, I used gpt-4o-mini to power the recommendation engine. Assignment of persona was rules based
              for MVP purposes.

              was a fun exercise on trying out Java for the first time. The goal was to be able to upload 100 images concurrently, with no front-end lag, within 5 minutes.
              Final version managed this in more like 10 seconds! I used websockets for real-time progress tracking, and S3 for file upload and storage. The web app was built
              using React, and the mobile app was built using react-native.

              users identify pills by taking a picture or uploading an image.
              You can also identify the pill by searching it by imprint, name,
              shape, and/or color. Users can also save searched medications to a
              list that they can access at any time. They can generate reminders
              for when to take these pills, and they can write diary entries to keep track of
              how they are interacting with the medication and how it makes them
              feel.

                >this project</a
              >
              as part of a four day Intermediate React unit. This week was
              probably the most cruicial for increasing my understanding of
              lifecycle methods. I later came back to this project and
              refactored it to use redux and interact with an actual backend,
              which I built myself. The backend was originally deployed to
              Heroku, but is now live on AWS using RDS, EBS, CloudFront, and
              CodePipeline. <br><br>
              NOTE: Deploy and GitHub link updated with new repo! 
              New repo is on a more modern stack of React hooks and Vite over class components and CRA. Heroku for backend. Slight facelift and deleting your own comments/posts added!

              team to develop a project based on a prompt. My role was to create
              the landing page which links to the react application via a sign
              in button.

          <p>
            My name is Victor Manuel Goico. I am a Front-End Software Engineer with some Full-Stack knowledge. I build
            web applications using Angular, React, and Express. <br><br>
            
            I have 5 years of professional experience as a Front-End Software Engineer 
            using Angular at Lukka. My tenure at Lukka began in October 2019 as a junior. 
            I worked my way up to L2 in a little over a year, and L3 shortly after that.
            Working in a fast-paced startup environment was the most learning I have ever 
            done in a short amount of time. Especially with the launch of the their first
            two products built in-house. Lots of fun, learning how to work in a team, then across teams, 
            then leading one, I can't think of a better way to have started my career.

            <br><br>
            Besides programming, I have a couple of hobbies that I do in my free
            time. I'm a bit of a PC enthusiast, and I play my fair share of
            video games as well. I also have four years of choir experience. I
            haven't been in one for a long time, but I still practice pretty
            often.
